# NanoCoreWar
The Nano Core War KOTH Tournament.

The main controller is Tournament.java.  The playerlist.txt file contains a list of warriors and their source files.  The file settings.txt contains a list of modifiable settings.  The file leaderboard.txt can optionally contain the leaderboard from an older tournament, to allow the tournament to run only the new matchups (this cannot detect when a warrior has been updated).

There are currently two simple example warriors, called Bob and Sally.
