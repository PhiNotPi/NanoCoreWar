# NanoCoreWar
The Nano Core War KOTH Tournament.

The main controller is Tournament.java.  The playerlist.txt file contains a list of warriors and their source files.  The file settings.txt contains a list of modifiable settings.  The file savedresults.txt can optionally contain saved results of previous matches (based on a hash of the compiled code, so that changes are detected automatically).  The most recent leaderboard is also saved in leaderboard.txt.

There are currently two simple example warriors, called Bob and Sally.
